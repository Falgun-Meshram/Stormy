# Stormy :- Simple Weather application
This is my second application called as the Stormy which basically is a static weather application without the location features which will be added in future builds.
# API Info
The weather details are fetched by the DarkSky APIs ( thier free tier which allows 1000 calls a day).

The following is the screenshot of the application:
